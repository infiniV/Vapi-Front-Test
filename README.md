## Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have:

1. **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
2. **npm** or **yarn**
3. **VAPI Account** with:
   - API Key
   - Configured phone numbers
   - At least one assistant

## Installation

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**:
   Create or update the `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   # VAPI Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_API_KEY=your_vapi_api_key_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_BASE_URL=https://api.vapi.ai
   ```

3. **Get your VAPI API Key**:
   - Log in to your VAPI dashboard
   - Navigate to API Keys section
   - Create or copy an existing API key
   - Replace `your_vapi_api_key_here` in `.env.local`

## Configuration

### Required VAPI Setup

Before using this application, you need to have the following configured in your VAPI account:

1. **SIP Trunk Credential** (if using BYO SIP):
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://api.vapi.ai/credential" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "provider": "byo-sip-trunk",
       "name": "My SIP Trunk",
       "gateways": [{"ip": "YOUR_SIP_SERVER_IP", "inboundEnabled": true}],
       "outboundAuthenticationPlan": {"authUsername": "your_username"}
     }'
   ```

2. **Phone Numbers**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://api.vapi.ai/phone-number" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "provider": "byo-phone-number",
       "name": "My Phone Number",
       "number": "YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER",
       "numberE164CheckEnabled": false,
       "credentialId": "YOUR_CREDENTIAL_ID"
     }'
   ```

3. **Assistant**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://api.vapi.ai/assistant" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "name": "My Assistant",
       "model": {"provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo"},
       "voice": {"provider": "eleven-labs", "voiceId": "pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB"},
       "firstMessage": "Hello, how can I help you today?"
     }'
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Development Mode**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your browser**:
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

3. **Production Build**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## How to Use

### SIP Trunk Management

Before making calls, you need to configure SIP trunk credentials:

1. **Create SIP Credential**:
   - Click "Add New" in the SIP Trunk Management section
   - Enter a name for your credential (e.g., "My SIP Trunk")
   - Add your SIP gateway IP address
   - Optionally add authentication username
   - Configure inbound/outbound settings
   - Click "Create Credential"

2. **Edit Gateway IP**:
   - Find your credential in the list
   - Click "Edit" next to the gateway IP
   - Enter the new IP address
   - Click "Save" (Note: This will delete and recreate the credential due to VAPI API limitations)

3. **Select Credential**:
   - Click on any credential card to select it
   - Selected credentials are highlighted with a blue border

### Making a Call

1. **Enter Assistant ID**: Paste your VAPI assistant ID in the form
2. **Select Phone Number**: Choose from available phone numbers in your account
3. **Enter Target Number**: Input the destination phone number (E.164 format recommended)
4. **Click "Make Call"**: Initiate the call

### Monitoring the Call

Once a call is initiated:

- **API Details**: View the exact request sent and response received
- **Call Status**: Real-time status updates (queued â†’ ringing â†’ in-progress â†’ ended)
- **WebSocket Monitor**: Live updates including:
  - Call state changes
  - Transcript updates
  - Cost information
  - Call end reasons

### WebSocket Events

The application connects to VAPI's WebSocket endpoint automatically when a call is made. You'll see real-time events including:

- Connection status
- Call status updates
- Transcript messages
- Cost updates
- Error messages

## API Endpoints Used

This application interacts with the following VAPI endpoints:

- `GET /phone-number` - List available phone numbers
- `POST /call` - Initiate outbound calls
- `GET /call/{id}` - Get call details
- WebSocket connections via monitor URLs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No phone numbers configured"**:
   - Ensure you have phone numbers set up in your VAPI account
   - Check your API key has the correct permissions

2. **"Failed to make call"**:
   - Verify your assistant ID is correct
   - Ensure the target phone number is in valid E.164 format
   - Check your VAPI account has sufficient credits

3. **WebSocket connection fails**:
   - This is normal for some call types
   - WebSocket URLs are only provided for certain call configurations

4. **API key errors**:
   - Verify your API key is correctly set in `.env.local`
   - Ensure the API key has the necessary permissions

5. **SIP Trunk Issues**:
   - Ensure your SIP gateway IP is correct and accessible
   - Check that inbound/outbound settings match your SIP server configuration
   - Verify authentication credentials if using outbound auth
   - Make sure your SIP server is configured to accept connections from VAPI
   - **Note**: Credential updates require delete/recreate due to VAPI API limitations

### Debug Mode

To enable detailed logging:

1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Check the Console tab for detailed API request/response logs
3. All VAPI API calls are logged with full details
